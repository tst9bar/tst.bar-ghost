### Summary of Facts

Tiger Woo ('Woo'): CEO of P


+ In July 2016, Woo on behalf of P entered into an oral agreement with Michelle Wee ('Wee') on behalf of the Debtor whereby the Debtor would use P's Premises from 01 August 2016 to 28 February 2019 at a monthly license fee of HK$
+ The Debtor has failed to pay any of the license fees, totalling HK$2,990,000 (the 'Debt').
+ D issued a personal cheque of HK$1,500,000 dated 30 August 2018 to purportedly settle part of the outstanding amount owed to P. (Refer to Exhibit TW-3.) 
+ P agreed to only deposit the personal cheque in late 2018 but the cheque was dishonoured upon presentation on 23 October 2018. (Refer to Exhibit 'TW-4'.)
	+ D in fact knew he would not be able to honour the said cheque. (Refer to paragraph 12 of D's affirmation 'Sung V: 1st: 11/9/2020')
	+ D alleged he issued the said cheque ...
+ Upon demand letter dated 10 November 2018 (refer to Exhibit 'TW-5'), P received four post-dated personal cheques amouthing to HK$2,990,000 from D on 17 December 2018.
	+ On 17 December 2018, D also provided a personal guarantee to gurantee the payment of the Debt by the Debtor. (Refer to the deed of guarantee at Exhibit 'TW-13')
	+ P therefore agreed to withhold from pursuing legal actions against the Debtor. (Refer to paragraphs 6 and 7 of Woo's second affirmation '' and Exhibit 'TW-7'.)
+ All four personal cheques were dishonoured upon presentation on 14 March 2019, 5 May 2019 and 3 Novomber 2019 respectively (thereinafter the 'Dishonoured Cheques'). (Refer to notices of dishonour from bank at Exhibit 'TW-8'.)

+ On 01 May 2019, Debtor issued 15 promissory notes amounting to HK$2,990,000 as a guarantee for payment of the Debt upon further negotiations and in response to the two Dishonoured Cheques dishonoured on 14 March 2019 (refer to paragraph 22 of Woo's first affirmation 'Woo T: 1st: 2/9/2020').
	+ D averred that the promissory notes were actually settlement of the Debt (refer to paragraphs 15 and 16 of D's affirmation 'Sung V: 1st: 11/9/2020')
+ On 10 August 2019, P's solicitors wrote to D to accept such undertaking in the form of 15 promissory notes while reserving P's rights for further actions (refer to paragraph 23 of Woo's first affirmation 'Woo T: 1st: 2/9/2020' and Exhibit 'VS-3').
+ On 30 November 2019, the promissory notes fell due but the Debtor did not honour them.

#### Chronology of Events



### Evidence





### Legal Proposition
D has no defence to P's claim.

D bears the burden to establish 




### The Opponent's Case
1. Duress


P: no protest in respect of personal cheque of HK$1,500,000


2. Interim security
D paragraphs 14 and 15 interim security





P denied para 5 of second


Further or alternatively, the nature of cheques as settlement of the Debt is clearly shown from the fact that D deed of guarantee convenanted to repay the Debt.
there simply would not be the case of a double security that an interim security (guarantee) of an alleged interim security (cheques)
para 7





if, which is denied by P, the threat or duress as alleged by D were true, it is illogical that P—a creditor—, having made such a drastic act, demanded the personal cheques to serve as mere interim security, rather than actual settlement which any reasonable creditor would have demanded.



3. P would not present the personal cheques



P para
no protest 
both personal cheque and Dishonoured Cheques, in particular in respect of the first two Dishonoured Cheques deposited.
if presentation of the first two did not bother, there is no reason that that of the remaining two would boter him.
P para 5 second, denies. 
on several occasions, for example in letters, it can be seen that P only agreed to delay presentation of the Dishonoured Cheques rather than not presenting at all as D alleged.
